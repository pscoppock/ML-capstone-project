about me:<br />
<br />
i would love to think that i was some some kind of intellectual:
either the dumbest smart guy, or the smartest dumb guy. can't say i
can tell the difference. i love to talk about ideas and concepts. i
forge odd metaphors instead of reciting cliches. like the
simularities between a friend of mine's house and an underwater
salt mine. my favorite word is salt by the way (weird choice i
know). to me most things in life are better as metaphors. i seek to
make myself a little better everyday, in some productively lazy
way. got tired of tying my shoes. considered hiring a five year
old, but would probably have to tie both of our shoes... decided to
only wear leather shoes dress shoes.<br />
<br />
about you:<br />
<br />
you love to have really serious, really deep conversations about
really silly stuff. you have to be willing to snap me out of a
light hearted rant with a kiss. you don't have to be funny, but you
have to be able to make me laugh. you should be able to bend spoons
with your mind, and telepathically make me smile while i am still
at work. you should love life, and be cool with just letting the
wind blow. extra points for reading all this and guessing my
favorite video game (no hints given yet). and lastly you have a
good attention span.
i am a chef: this is what that means.<br />
1. i am a workaholic.<br />
2. i love to cook regardless of whether i am at work.<br />
3. i love to drink and eat foods that are probably really bad for
me.<br />
4. i love being around people that resemble line 1-3.<br />
i love the outdoors and i am an avid skier. if its snowing i will
be in tahoe at the very least. i am a very confident and friendly.
i'm not interested in acting or being a typical guy. i have no time
or patience for rediculous acts of territorial pissing. overall i
am a very likable easygoing individual. i am very adventurous and
always looking forward to doing new things and hopefully sharing it
with the right person.
i'm not ashamed of much, but writing public text on an online
dating site makes me pleasantly uncomfortable. i'll try to be as
earnest as possible in the noble endeavor of standing naked before
the world.<br />
<br />
i've lived in san francisco for 15 years, and both love it and find
myself frustrated with its deficits. lots of great friends and
acquaintances (which increases my apprehension to put anything on
this site), but i'm feeling like meeting some new people that
aren't just friends of friends. it's okay if you are a friend of a
friend too. chances are, if you make it through the complex
filtering process of multiple choice questions, lifestyle
statistics, photo scanning, and these indulgent blurbs of text
without moving quickly on to another search result, you are
probably already a cultural peer and at most 2 people removed. at
first, i thought i should say as little as possible here to avoid
you, but that seems silly.<br />
<br />
as far as culture goes, i'm definitely more on the weird side of
the spectrum, but i don't exactly wear it on my sleeve. once you
get me talking, it will probably become increasingly apparent that
while i'd like to think of myself as just like everybody else (and
by some definition i certainly am), most people don't see me that
way. that's fine with me. most of the people i find myself
gravitating towards are pretty weird themselves. you probably are
too.
i work in a library and go to school. . .
hey how's it going? currently vague on the profile i know, more to
come soon. looking to meet new folks outside of my circle of
friends. i'm pretty responsive on the reply tip, feel free to drop
a line. cheers.

essay1
currently working as an international agent for a freight
forwarding company. import, export, domestic you know the
works.<br />
online classes and trying to better myself in my free time. perhaps
a hours worth of a good book or a video game on a lazy sunday.
dedicating everyday to being an unbelievable badass.
i make nerdy software for musicians, artists, and experimenters to
indulge in their own weirdness, but i like to spend time away from
the computer when working on my artwork (which is typically more
concerned with group dynamics and communication, than with visual
form, objects, or technology). i also record and deejay dance,
noise, pop, and experimental music (most of which electronic or at
least studio based). besides these relatively ego driven
activities, i've been enjoying things like meditation and tai chi
to try and gently flirt with ego death.
reading things written by old dead people
work work work work + play

essay2
making people laugh.<br />
ranting about a good salting.<br />
finding simplicity in complexity, and complexity in simplicity.
being silly. having ridiculous amonts of fun wherever. being a
smart ass. ohh and i can cook. ;)
improvising in different contexts. alternating between being
present and decidedly outside of a moment, or trying to hold both
at once. rambling intellectual conversations that hold said
conversations in contempt while seeking to find something that
transcends them. being critical while remaining generous. listening
to and using body language--often performed in caricature or large
gestures, if not outright interpretive dance. dry, dark, and
raunchy humor.
playing synthesizers and organizing books according to the library
of congress classification system
creating imagery to look at:<br />

essay3
the way i look. i am a six foot half asian, half caucasian mutt. it
makes it tough not to notice me, and for me to blend in.
nan
my large jaw and large glasses are the physical things people
comment on the most. when sufficiently stimulated, i have an
unmistakable cackle of a laugh. after that, it goes in more
directions than i care to describe right now. maybe i'll come back
to this.
socially awkward but i do my best
i smile a lot and my inquisitive nature

essay4
books:<br />
absurdistan, the republic, of mice and men (only book that made me
want to cry), catcher in the rye, the prince.<br />
<br />
movies:<br />
gladiator, operation valkyrie, the producers, down periscope.<br />
<br />
shows:<br />
the borgia, arrested development, game of thrones, monty
python<br />
<br />
music:<br />
aesop rock, hail mary mallon, george thorogood and the delaware

<br />
food:<br />
i'm down for anything.
i am die hard christopher moore fan. i don't really watch a lot of
tv unless there is humor involved. i am kind of stuck on 90's
alternative music. i am pretty much a fan of everything though... i
do need to draw a line at most types of electronica.
okay this is where the cultural matrix gets so specific, it's like
being in the crosshairs.<br />
<br />
for what it's worth, i find myself reading more non-fiction than
fiction. it's usually some kind of philosophy, art, or science text
by silly authors such as ranciere, de certeau, bataille,
baudrillard, butler, stein, arendt, nietzche, zizek, etc. i'll
often throw in some weird new age or pop-psychology book in the mix
as well. as for fiction, i enjoy what little i've read of eco,
perec, wallace, bolao, dick, vonnegut, atwood, delilo, etc. when i
was young, i was a rabid asimov reader.<br />
<br />
directors i find myself drawn to are makavejev, kuchar, jodorowsky,
herzog, hara, klein, waters, verhoeven, ackerman, hitchcock, lang,
gorin, goddard, miike, ohbayashi, tarkovsky, sokurov, warhol, etc.
but i also like a good amount of "trashy" stuff. too much to
name.<br />
<br />
i definitely enjoy the character development that happens in long
form episodic television over the course of 10-100 episodes, which
a 1-2hr movie usually can't compete with. some of my recent tv
favorites are: breaking bad, the wire, dexter, true blood, the
prisoner, lost, fringe.<br />
<br />
a smattered sampling of the vast field of music i like and deejay:
art ensemble, sun ra, evan parker, lil wayne, dj funk, mr. fingers,
maurizio, rob hood, dan bell, james blake, nonesuch recordings,
omar souleyman, ethiopiques, fela kuti, john cage, meredith monk,
robert ashley, terry riley, yoko ono, merzbow, tom tom club, jit,
juke, bounce, hyphy, snap, crunk, b'more, kuduro, pop, noise, jazz,
techno, house, acid, new/no wave, (post)punk, etc.<br />
<br />
a few of the famous art/dance/theater folk that might locate my
sensibility: andy warhol, bruce nauman, yayoi kusama, louise
bourgeois, tino sehgal, george kuchar, michel duchamp, marina
abramovic, gelatin, carolee schneeman, gustav metzger, mike kelly,
mike smith, andrea fraser, gordon matta-clark, jerzy grotowski,
samuel beckett, antonin artaud, tadeusz kantor, anna halperin,
merce cunningham, etc. i'm clearly leaving out a younger generation
of contemporary artists, many of whom are friends.<br />
<br />
local food regulars: sushi zone, chow, ppq, pagolac, lers ros,
burma superstar, minako, shalimar, delfina pizza, rosamunde,
arinells, suppenkuche, cha-ya, blue plate, golden era, etc.
bataille, celine, beckett. . .<br />
lynch, jarmusch, r.w. fassbender. . .<br />
twin peaks &amp; fishing w/ john<br />
joy division, throbbing gristle, cabaret voltaire. . .<br />
vegetarian pho and coffee
music: bands, rappers, musicians<br />
at the moment: thee oh sees.<br />
forever: wu-tang<br />
books: artbooks for days<br />
audiobooks: my collection, thick (thanks audible)<br />
shows: live ones<br />
food: with stellar friends whenever<br />
movies &gt; tv<br />
podcast: radiolab, this american life, the moth, joe rogan, the
